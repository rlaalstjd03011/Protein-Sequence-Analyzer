# Protein-Sequence-Analyzer - p53 Protein
Amino Acid Composition Tool

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the amino acid composition of the p53 protein sequence obtained from NCBI. It calculates the frequency and percentage of each amino acid and visualizes the results using a bar chart.

## Data Source
- Protein sequence file: [NCBI p53 Protein FASTA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/)

## Features
- Reads protein sequences from a FASTA file
- Calculates amino acid counts and their relative percentages
- Organizes and sorts data using pandas
- Visualizes amino acid composition with matplotlib bar chart
